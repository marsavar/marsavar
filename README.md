### hey.

I'm a software engineer based in London, currently working at [Snyk](https://www.snyk.io).

Previously, I worked at [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/) in the Investigations & Reporting team, a small group of developers using technology to uncover stories and building tools to make collaboration between reporters and whistleblowers more secure. I was a core member of the engineering team that implemented [CoverDrop](https://www.coverdrop.org/), a secure and anonymous messaging platform embedded in the news app.

I started my career in book publishing before making the transition to engineering, but I've been tinkering with code since the late '90s.

I speak Italian, English and Japanese, and I can get by in French and Spanish.\
I enjoy, in no particular order: contemporary fiction, cycling, [Rust](https://www.rustlang.com/).
