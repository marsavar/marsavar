### hey.

I'm a software engineer based in London.\
I work at [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/) in the Investigations & Reporting team, a small group of developers using technology to uncover stories and building tools to make collaboration between reporters and whistleblowers more secure.

I speak Italian, English and Japanese, and I can get by in French and Spanish.\
I enjoy, in no particular order: contemporary fiction, cycling, [Rust](https://www.rustlang.com/).
